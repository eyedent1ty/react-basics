1. Components
2. React Composition
3. Props
4. State

# Two-way binding

- Implicitly enforcing that some value in the DOM is always consistent with some React state.

- Value, as well as changes to the value are not handled in the component itself
  but in a parent component.

# Presentational vs. Stateful Components

# Stateless vs. Stateful Components
